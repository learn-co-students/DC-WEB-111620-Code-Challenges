# Code Challenge Repo: One Repo to Rule Them All!

## Student

Please follow the instructions. If your instructor's instructions differ from below, always listen to your instructor instead.

### Do This Once Before Your First Ever Challenge

Before your first code challenge, please Star this repo. This will trigger an invitation to join this repo as a collaborator. Once you get the email invitation, please accept the invitation. Please note that it may take a while for the invitation to arrive depending on how many invites are in the queue. If you do not see an invite by the next day, please ask your instructor for help. They can add you manually if needed - just give them your GitHub username.

If you lose your invitation, go to the following link while logged in to GitHub: https://github.com/learn-co-students/repo-name/invitations (replace <repo-name> with the actual repo name). 

Note that invitations expire after 7 days.

Your instructor will make this repo private once you have all been added.

### Instructions for Every Challenge

Before **every challenge**, clone down this repo using the `git clone` command and the Clone HTTPS link. This is important - we need you to have a clean repo to work from. _Do not use your old clones of this repo!_

`cd` into the directory of your current code challenge.

Create and checkout a new branch using your first and last name: `git checkout -b bartelby-cumberbuttons`

Push your branch: `git push origin bartelby-cumberbuttons`

Your instructor will confirm that your branch was pushed successfully. Once all branches appear, your instructor will ask you to start work on the challenge.

At the end of the challenge, make your final commit and push your branch! Await your grade brave almighty student!


## Instructors

### Before the First Challenge

Please check that all students are listed as collaborators with Write access. They should have accepted their invitations also.

If any student does not appear and was not automatically added, please add them.

### Before Every Challenge

Please add the appropriate code challenge to this repo in its own directory. Ensure the .git folder is not in the code challenge folder. If you wish, you can remove previous code challenges from this repo.

If you changed collaborator access to Read only, please update to Write.

Also ensure that the only branch available is main/master. There should be no additional branches before a code challenge.

Ask students to clone down the repo when ready and push a branch with their name using an empty or pointless commit. Once all branches appear, start the challenge.

### After every challenge

Pull down the repo and grade.

Clean up/delete all branches except main/master.

Put your grades in Canvas.

Change collaborator access if you wish (optional).

If you wish, remove the code challenge from the repo. If you keep old challenges in, please name the directories simply, e.g. "Phase-1-Code-Challenge-NameOfChallenge".

Thank you for your hard work!
